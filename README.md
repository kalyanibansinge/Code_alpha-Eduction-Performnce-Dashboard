# Code_alpha-Eduction-Performnce-Dashboard
🎓 Successfully completed my internship project with Codalpha!  📊 Project Title: Student Performance Analysis in Mathematics and Portuguese 🔍 This project involved analyzing student data to identify key factors influencing academic performance, using data-driven insights to support better educational strategies.
The Student Performance Data Set (Portuguese) is a well-known dataset used for educational data mining, statistical learning, and predictive modeling. It contains information about students’ academic performance along with various background, social, and school-related attributes. This dataset is especially popular for regression and classification tasks like predicting final grades or identifying at-risk students.
